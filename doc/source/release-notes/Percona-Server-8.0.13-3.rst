Known Issues
================================================================================

Due to the significant structural changes in 8.0, this was a more
difficult porting process than is typical. We have a few features and
issues outstanding that should be resolved in the next release.

Pending Feature Re-Implementations and Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  :psbug:`4892`: Re-Implement Expanded Fast Index Creation feature.
-  :psbug:`5216`: Re-Implement Utility User feature.
-  :psbug:`5143`: Identify Percona features which can make use of dynamic privileges instead of ``SUPER``

Notable Issues in Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  :psbug:`5148`: Regression in Compressed Columns Feature when using ``innodb-force-recovery``
-  :psbug:`4996`: Regression in User Statistics feature where ``TOTAL_CONNECTIONS`` field report incorrect data
-  :psbug:`4933`: Regression in Slow Query Logging Extensions feature where incorrect transaction id
   accounting can cause an assert during certain DDLs.
-  :psbug:`5206`: TokuDB: A crash can occur in TokuDB when using Native Partioning and the optimizer 
    has ``index_merge_union`` enabled. Workaround by using ``SET SESSION optimizer_switch="index_merge_union=off";``
-  :psbug:`5174`: MyRocks: Attempting to use unsupported features against MyRocks can lead to a crash rather than an error.
-  :psbug:`5024`: MyRocks: Queries can return the wrong results on tables with no primary key, non-unique
    ``CHAR``/``VARCHAR`` rows, and ``UTF8MB4`` charset.
-  :psbug:`5045`: MyRocks: Altering a column or table comment cause the table to be rebuilt
